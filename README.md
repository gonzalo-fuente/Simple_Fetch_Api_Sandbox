# What is the Fetch API?

The Fetch API is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers.
This API allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API.
